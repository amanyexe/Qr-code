It's always great to learn while doing things ,
things that i learned or revised from this project :-

  1- target attribute that i revised i almost forgot that something like this exists.
  2- hsl() color scheme that i didn't know i used to use hex code for coloring.
  3- I was having problems to vertically align the element and then i found one good solution on StackOverflow


```css
.card {
  position: absolute;
  top:0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin: auto;
}
